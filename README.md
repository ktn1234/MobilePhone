# MobilePhone
Implements contacts feature of a mobile phone using a parallel ArrayList (not very practical but a challenge indeed) for learning purposes
..because why not?!

  Better possibilities:
  ->Use a map
  ->Create an ArrayList with contact class object that contains the name and phone number
  
  Best regards,
